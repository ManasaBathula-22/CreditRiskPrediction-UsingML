# How to Run the Notebook

1. Download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries (see below).
3. Open 'Project_CreditRiskPrediction.ipynb' using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Run each cell sequentially for:
   - Data preprocessing
   - Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, XGBClassifier)
   - Evaluation & results

# Requirements & Dependencies

Install the following Python libraries:
   bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost

Or use the 'requirements.txt' if available.

# Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- XGBClassifier

# Notes

- Dataset source: 'Credit Risk Prediction.csv'
- Evaluation based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Confusion matrices included for each model.
