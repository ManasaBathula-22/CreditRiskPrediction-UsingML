**Summary Report**

# Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a credit card.

# Steps Taken
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
2. Handled missing values and verified absence of categorical data.
3. Performed data visualization to understand feature relationships.
4. Scaled features using "RobustScaler".
6. Handled class imbalance using SMOTE.
7. Trained five models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree Classifier, XGBClassifier.
8. Evaluated model performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

# Challenges Faced
- Dealing with imbalanced class distribution.
- Avoiding overfitting while improving accuracy.

# Contributions
All preprocessing, model selection, tuning, and analysis were done collaboratively. Primary contributions include model evaluation and feature engineering.
